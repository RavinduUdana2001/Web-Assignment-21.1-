        The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity.

The 17 SDGs are integratedâ€”they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability.

Countries have committed to prioritize progress for those who're furthest behind. The SDGs are designed to end poverty, hunger, AIDS, and discrimination against women and girls.

The creativity, knowhow, technology and financial resources from all of society is necessary to achieve the SDGs in every context.

       COVID-19 is the most wide-reaching public health crisis our world has faced in a long time. It has significantly impacted practically every aspect of business operations. COVID-19 has made three aspects very clear:
	<pre>
  - The centrality of sustainability for business resilience.

	- health, safety and wellbeing became central to the 
	  resiliency and sustainability discussion in a way that
	  it has never occurred before.

	- The role of partnerships; nobody
	  can deal with a pandemic on their own.</pre>
